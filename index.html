            <p>
              Hi!<br />
              I am Semih Utku ÖZGAN, a person brimming with excitement for a
              future filled with technology and innovation. I am 23 years old
              and reside in Ankara. After completing my university education, I
              decided to shape my future by pushing the boundaries of technology
              and innovation.
              <br />
              <br />
              My education in computer science fueled my interest in the world
              of technology. My curiosity, particularly in the Python
              programming language, inspired me to develop projects in image
              processing and object recognition. These projects honed my ability
              to process complex data and convert it into meaningful
              information. I can now transform intricate data into actionable
              insights.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now, I feel it's time to advance my career. I am working in
              front-end development, focusing on making websites more
              user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Using the power of
              design to enhance websites is a passion of mine. Usability and
              aesthetics are among my top priorities in every project.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to technology and innovation, I also enjoy savoring
              life's experiences. Basketball is a hobby that helps me maintain
              both physical and mental balance. I take to the court to satisfy
              my competitive spirit and to experience the beauty of teamwork.
              Embracing a planned and structured lifestyle has been essential in
              my journey. By setting goals and staying committed to achieving
              them, I make progress in both my professional and personal life.
              Effective time management and disciplined work have been key
              contributors to my success.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have grand aspirations for the future. I aim to make greater
              strides in the world of technology and innovation, contribute to
              new projects, and add value to society. My desire for continuous
              learning and self-improvement will propel me forward on this path.
              Collaborating and participating in new projects heralds an
              exciting future.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am ready to open the doors to a future filled with technology
              and innovation. I look forward to exploring further, crafting new
              success stories, and making the world a better place through
              innovation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thank you...

                        The foosball ball tracking object detection model is an
                        artificial intelligence-based system developed
                        specifically for monitoring and analyzing foosball
                        games. This model performs object detection by tracking
                        the movement of the ball on the foosball table and
                        continuously updates the position of the ball. This is
                        useful for better understanding foosball matches,
                        evaluating players' strategies and providing data for
                        potential performance improvements.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The main function of the model is to use the YOLOv7 (You
                        Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to analyze
                        the video stream and detect the pinball ball. This
                        algorithm works very quickly and effectively to detect
                        objects in the image and determine their positions.
                        Using these object detection results, the model
                        continuously tracks the motion of the pinball.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The success of the model is quite impressive, as
                        tracking and detecting a fast-moving ball on a foosball
                        table is quite a challenging task. The 80% success rate
                        shows that the model works successfully despite this
                        challenge. This provides a reliable tool for studying
                        and analyzing pinball games.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The ability to track a foosball ball offers potential
                        for a range of applications. For example, analyzing
                        foosball matches can help players improve their
                        strategy. It can also be used for educational purposes,
                        helping beginners to understand the basics of the game
                        of pinball. It can also be used for analyzing
                        professional foosball tournaments and evaluating player
                        performance.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This object detection model that tracks a foosball ball
                        stands out as an example of how AI technology can be
                        used in sports analysis and training. Such technologies
                        can be used in a wider range of application areas and
                        offer new perspectives in the world of sports.

                        In my project, I developed a program to detect parking
                        lots using image processing techniques. This program
                        works with important Python-based libraries such as
                        numpy and pandas. In the first step, we take the images
                        from the camera and convert them to black and white
                        format. This is an important step to simplify and speed
                        up the process.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When working on a black-and-white image, we use corner
                        and edge detection algorithms to identify regions that
                        remain in white. This step allows us to identify each
                        parking lot slot in the image. We then determine whether
                        the parking lot is empty or occupied by calculating the
                        pixel count of these white regions.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The threshold is a critical component of this detection
                        process. The threshold determines how many white pixels
                        should be present. When the threshold is exceeded, we
                        know that a vehicle is in the parking lot. As a result
                        of this process, we detect empty and occupied parking
                        lots.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Finally, we save these detection results in a SQL
                        database file. This database file contains information
                        about the status of each parking slot. Thus, users or
                        administrators can monitor the status in the parking lot
                        at any time and know about the free spaces.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This project provides a great convenience in parking lot
                        management and supervision. Thanks to image processing
                        techniques and database management, continuous
                        monitoring and tracking of parking lots becomes
                        possible. Advanced algorithms and artificial
                        intelligence technologies can also be integrated to
                        improve and further optimize this project. In this way,
                        parking lot management can be made more effective and
                        efficient.
